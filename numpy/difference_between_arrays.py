#48) Write a NumPy program to find the set difference between two arrays. The set difference will
#return sorted, distinct values in array1 that are not in array2.
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80])
print("Array1: ",array1)
array2 = [10, 30, 40, 50, 70]
print("Array2: ",array2)
print("Unique values in array1 that are not in array2:")
print(np.setdiff1d(array1, array2))
